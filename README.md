# github-alive — A living contribution graph

Your GitHub contribution graph becomes a self-evolving abstract pattern.
Real commits blend seamlessly into the design — a sprint of 50 commits looks
like a natural peak, not a disruption.

## How it works

github-alive runs daily (via GitHub Actions) and computes how many commits
your contribution graph *should* show for today using a deterministic
mathematical function. It then counts your real commits for today and fills
the gap if needed.

**Real activity blends in naturally** — most of the time. If a sprint lands on
a peak zone, it reinforces the wave. If it lands on a valley, it creates a
visible spike above the pattern. Either way, alive.py never adds synthetic
commits on top of real ones — it only fills the gap up to the target.

```
target  = base_commits(today)   # from the wave function
real    = count_real_commits()  # your actual GitHub activity (excl. alive repo)
delta   = max(0, target - real) # only fill the gap
```

---

## Features

- **Deterministic** — same date always produces the same pattern. No state files, no database.
- **Self-healing** — real commits count toward the target. Work more, fill less.
- **Minimal setup** — two secrets in GitHub Actions (`ALIVE_TOKEN` + `GH_USER`) and it runs forever.
- **Organic** — overlapping sine waves at different frequencies create texture that looks hand-drawn.
- **Flexible** — runs daily via GitHub Actions; includes backfill tools for historical gaps.

## Installation

### 1. Create the `alive` repo on GitHub

Create a public (or private) repository named `alive` in your GitHub account.
It just needs to exist — github-alive will commit to it.

### 2. Clone this repo and install dependencies

```bash
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/github-alive
cd github-alive
pip install requests
```

### 3. Configure credentials

Copy the example config and fill in your details:

```bash
cp config.example.json config.json
```

```json
{
  "github_token": "ghp_...",
  "github_user": "your-username",
  "alive_repo": "alive"
}
```

> `config.json` is in `.gitignore` — it will never be committed.

Alternatively, use environment variables:

```bash
export ALIVE_GH_TOKEN=ghp_...   # preferred (avoids GitHub Actions built-in token clash)
export GITHUB_TOKEN=ghp_...     # also works as fallback for local use
export GITHUB_USER=your-username
```

### 4. Run manually

```bash
python3 alive.py
```

### 5. Set up GitHub Actions (automated daily run)

The included workflow runs three times a day at **02:00, 10:00, and 18:00 UTC**.

Add these secrets to your repository (`Settings → Secrets → Actions`):

| Secret | Value |
|---|---|
| `ALIVE_TOKEN` | Personal access token with `repo` + `user` scope |
| `GH_USER` | Your GitHub username |

The workflow file is already at `.github/workflows/alive.yml`.

## How the pattern is generated

The pattern is produced by five overlapping sine waves, each operating at a
different timescale:

| Wave | Period | Role |
|---|---|---|
| `w1` | 26 weeks | Primary rhythm — broad rise and fall |
| `w2` | 13 weeks | Harmonic — mid-scale structure |
| `w3` | 52 weeks | Yearly drift — slow background mood |
| `w4` | 7 days + slow phase drift | Day-of-week texture |
| `w5` | diagonal | Cross-grid ripple |

They combine with weighted mixing:

```python
combined = w1*0.35 + w2*0.25 + w3*0.15 + w4*0.15 + w5*0.10
commits  = round(3 + (combined + 1) * 18.5)   # maps [-1,1] → [3, 40]
```

The result is a pattern where no two weeks are identical, yet the whole
graph flows with visual coherence — peaks cluster, valleys breathe,
and diagonal streaks emerge from the interference of the waves.
